CI Design
     
I love what I do. I also love working with my clients. It's the whole package for me that makes it work. My clients trust that I have their best interests at heart! That is when it all comes together beautifully.

That’s why my commitment and passion resonate in equal measure across all briefs and budgets. My philosophy is to create engaging, well executed and effective work that creates an impression; I like to learn; build up skills; work with diverse, positive clients who can put their trust in my skills and experience and to enjoy each working day.

Please browse my portfolio containing various visual communications material: logo design, brochure design and corporate identity design.

CLIENT TESTIMONIAL

“We are an engineering company based in Perth, Australia. Working with Lauren remotely from a different country had no impact on the exceptional service we received from her. She was extremely professional in the way she managed the development of our corporate identity including the design of our new logo and website.  Her effortless creativity and industry specific insight coupled with quick turn around on deliverables meant that we could focus on building our business whilst Lauren took care of our CI. Our clients are very impressed with the website and the feedback has been very positive. Lauren was proactive in sourcing high quality printers for our business cards which was couriered to us internationally.   We would highly recommend LW Design and again use of Lauren’s services in the future.”</h2>
