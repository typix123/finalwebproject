<h2>I'm Lauren. I'm a professional, established and experienced, logo designer and web designer based in Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa. I work for incredible clients, providing an exceptional full graphic design and web design service with a goal to create awareness of your brand for bigger sales.

My Mission: to design or revamp your company website or to design a new logo or logo revamp so that it is beautiful and functional;  To enjoy building meaningful and ongoing business relationships with my clients to meet their needs in the best way possible with reliable, personal and friendly service. I love working with my clients and provided a design that fulfills their needs. I find it so rewarding!

With 27 years in my business in graphic design (since 1989) and web design (since 2000) combined, I have always done my best to stay ahead of the curve, providing a solution that is creative, unique and professional!

You are here either because you need a new corporate company website or to revamp your existing tired website that has flaws and not being ranked by Google. I offer the full package including effective SEO, social media marketing, hosting through my preferred supplier and web maintenance too. Along with a website you may also now require a revamped and modern logo design and corporate identity to follow through. If this is what you are after, you have found the right place! Examples of my work can be found on this website.

I specialize (only) in HTML responsive, simple yet attractive and clean brochure type web design as seen in my portfolio.
